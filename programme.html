        I used TinkerCad to create my 3D image of the pizza. I found TinkerCad very user friendly, with all the buttons and tools clearly labelled. Compared to blender which I tested out, I found on Blender that it is less user friendly and requires more testing and effort to figure out how to use it efficiantly. This meant I was able to get started creating reasonably quickly as I understood somewhat how I could go about it. Although with TinkerCad there was a lot of things that I couldn't do to my model like add texture and smooth objects. Whereas with Blender there was a lot more options in terms of tools.
